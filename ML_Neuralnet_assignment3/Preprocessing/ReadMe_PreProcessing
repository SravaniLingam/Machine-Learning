Programming Language used: Java 

1. Pre-processing:

Libraries used:
We have used JXL(Jxl.jar) library for fetching and writing data to and from excel sheet(.xls)
We have also used Apache Commons(commons-lang3-3.0.jar) for math functions like sqrt and to check if a string can be converted to a number or not.

Assumptions and Input:
Input dataset is given in a excel sheet(.xls)

Note:
If the value is categorical or nominal, it is converted to numerical values. For this we have used TreeMap dataStructure to assign and store different values to the keys(categories).

After the conversion of data to numeric, we are standardizing the dataset.

Example:
The values set to various categories: {Iris-setosa=1, Iris-versicolor=2, Iris-virginica=3}

CODE COMPILATION and EXECUTION for preprocessing:

Please add the above mention libraries from library jar files(folder).
In Windows/Mac Environment open program in Eclipse IDE and compile it.

Input:

Please check the input_sample.png file for input sample.

1st argument is the filepath of the raw dataset and 2nd argument is the filepath of processed data set.

Sample i/p: "/Users/shivapodugu/Desktop/ML/Assignment3/iris_raw_dataset.xls" "/Users/shivapodugu/Desktop/ML/postprocessedData__.xls"

The input raw-datasets are saved in inputFiles folder, please use these .xls files as input raw datasets.

Sample Output:

The values set to various categories: {Iris-setosa=1, Iris-versicolor=2, Iris-virginica=3}
standardizing under process..
Post Processed File is created and stored in /Users/shivapodugu/Desktop/ML/postprocessedData__.xls
